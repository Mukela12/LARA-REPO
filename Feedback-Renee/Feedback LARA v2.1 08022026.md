Hi Rahul,

Thanks again for sharing the latest screens. The overall flow is coming together really well, and it’s already feeling much closer to a teacher-first, classroom-usable tool.

I’ve attached:

* the feedback table (prioritised P1/P2), and   
* a PDF and PPT with screenshots so you can see each point in context.

A lot of this is polish and cognitive-load reduction rather than new scope — the goal is to make the teacher approval path faster and more reliable in a live lesson.  Well done you\! Renee

Points for discussion

* How to go about hosting app domain?  
* Payment – my intention is these changes, 1 pilot in 1 class, any pressing changes? At that point ready for pilot so pay then.   
* How long is is feedback available to student using the provided code?  
* Security and privacy understanding – much easier for teacher to use first name

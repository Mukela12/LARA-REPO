You’ve made huge progress from V1 to V2, and it really shows. The product feels more coherent, more teacher-centred, and much closer to the experience we’re aiming for. I know how many moving parts you’ve been juggling, and it’s clear how much thought and care has gone into each iteration. Thank you for sticking with the detail, the feedback loops, and the constant refinement. It’s making a real difference to the quality of LARA.
